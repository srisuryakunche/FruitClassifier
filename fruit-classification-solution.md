## 1. Introduction

The Fruit Image Classification project is a machine learning solution that leverages transfer learning and the MobileNetV2 architecture to classify images of fruits. This project demonstrates the power of deep learning techniques in image recognition tasks, specifically focusing on identifying ten different types of fruits with high accuracy.

## 2. Problem Definition

### Objectives
- Develop a robust image classification model for fruits
- Classify images into 10 distinct fruit categories:
  - Apple
  - Banana
  - Avocado
  - Cherry
  - Kiwi
  - Mango
  - Orange
  - Pineapple
  - Strawberries
  - Watermelon

### Challenges
The project addresses several key challenges in image classification:
- Variations in image lighting
- Different camera angles
- Diverse background conditions
- Ensuring model generalizability

## 3. Approach and Solution

### Key Approach Components
1. **Dataset Preprocessing**
   - Utilized TensorFlow's `image_dataset_from_directory`
